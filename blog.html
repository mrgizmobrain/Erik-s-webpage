            <p>I had trouble pushing my commit to git hub becasue apparently you need a key. I ended up just using github desktop to do the pushes.</p>
            <p>Some things I leared was how to resize a picture and how to keep the original crop factor.</p>
            <p>Overall I found this assignment refreshingly easy but also so much needed practice with what we've been learning in class.</p>

            <p>I thought this assignment was really quite fun and challenging at the same time. It also totally helped me to understand how to apply what we learned in class. Some of the hardest things to figure out for me was how to get the pictures to resize correct inside the posts container and how to get the filter inputs to come after the filter text. With the images I ended up turning them into block and setting a max width of 100% and max height of some set pixle count. For the filters I set the filter-input-container to flex.</p>
            <p>I definetly used W3schools and just Google in general when figuring out how to do certain things. I also used the lecture code that was available to refresh myself on some of the things that I didn't quite get. Specifically I had to google some stuff on how to get the images to look how I wanted them that was probably the thing that took the longest.</p>

            <p>I had alot of difficulty trying to figure out how to do all the filtering while being able to undo it. I ended up just cloning all the posts and every time I updated the filter I would re put in all the posts and then filter out the ones I didn't want again.</p>

            <p>The hardest part of this assignment was definetly trying to figure out how to read a file and save and send a response within the read function as to know get messed up by the asynchronousness of the way it deals with the content of the read. I ended up after checking if there was any content in the saved var it would either call to read the function and then save the content then send the response or it would just use the saved content to send the response directly.</p>

            <p>Overall this assignment looked hard at first glance but when I actually started doing each piece it all sort of fell together. There wasn't one particular thing that was harder then the rest. That being said while doing the assignment it felt like I was gaining a better understanding of how to implament what we learned in class and it made how the little pieces of how layouts and partials and how they intertwine feel much more clear. I guess the hardest part was templatizing index.html but even that was just a case of trial and error.</p>
