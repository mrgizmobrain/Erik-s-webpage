        <p>I had trouble pushing my commit to git hub becasue apparently you need a key. I ended up just using github desktop to do the pushes.</p>
        <p>Some things I leared was how to resize a picture and how to keep the original crop factor.</p>
        <p>Overall I found this assignment refreshingly easy but also so much needed practice with what we've been learning in class.</p>
