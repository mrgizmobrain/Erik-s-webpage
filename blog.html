            <p>I had trouble pushing my commit to git hub becasue apparently you need a key. I ended up just using github desktop to do the pushes.</p>
            <p>Some things I leared was how to resize a picture and how to keep the original crop factor.</p>
            <p>Overall I found this assignment refreshingly easy but also so much needed practice with what we've been learning in class.</p>

            <p>I thought this assignment was really quite fun and challenging at the same time. It also totally helped me to understand how to apply what we learned in class. Some of the hardest things to figure out for me was how to get the pictures to resize correct inside the posts container and how to get the filter inputs to come after the filter text. With the images I ended up turning them into block and setting a max width of 100% and max height of some set pixle count. For the filters I set the filter-input-container to flex.</p>
            <p>I definetly used W3schools and just Google in general when figuring out how to do certain things. I also used the lecture code that was available to refresh myself on some of the things that I didn't quite get. Specifically I had to google some stuff on how to get the images to look how I wanted them that was probably the thing that took the longest.</p>

            <p>I had alot of difficulty trying to figure out how to do all the filtering while being able to undo it. I ended up just cloning all the posts and every time I updated the filter I would re put in all the posts and then filter out the ones I didn't want again.</p>
